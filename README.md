# Smile_Detector
This code is a smile detector which will find a face and detect when a person is smiling. 
In order to use this you can use Anaconda's Spyder Application.

This Smile Detector uses the Viola - Jones Algorithm to detect the face and when a person is smiling. 
If you want to learn about how the Viola - Jones Algorithm works, you can check out my article on it.
